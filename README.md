# EEG-DNN-Music
Experiment to see if an EEG, using DNNs can detect the genre of music being listened to.
The device used is a MindWave EEG. I plan to create "spectrograms" with the data collected while listening to various types of music. These spectrograms will be passed through a DNN designed for texture, object, or basic regression image classification networks.
This is only an experiment and will most likely not work, but still fun to work with and keep my machine learning skills up.

Tech Stack(so far):
Python, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Tensorflow, Multithreading, Serial Interface, Pandas
